entrance into the monastery, passed the flower of his
youth and the maturity of his manhood in the prac-
tice of all religion and virtue, he was two years before
his death struck with blindness; but it was tc him a
muse of rejoicing. And we are again told how one
winter's night he was present in the service of the
choir‚ singing with the choristers, and how, having
songht his bed, and remaining there but a short time,
he returned very early in the morning to the chureii,
and devoutly assisted at the mass which was· then
being performed in honour of the Blessed Virgin (for
it was within the octove of the Conception); and how
hethere prostrated himself and sang the seven peni·
tential psalma and the hymn “Jesu nostra redemptio‚”
adoring the sacrament the while, when suddenly, in
the midst of his devotione, he was struck by para«
lysia And so when the mass was finished he was
carried to his hed, and there, having received the holy
communion, he lay for some days in a state of great
weaknsss, but afterwards recovering, he was to the
time of his death constant in religious exercises, in
prayer, in confession, in almsgiving, and in making
reparaticn to the best of his power both to God ond
man

Christmas having passed, the abbot celebrated the
festivales the Purifioation in the abbey church with
his monlm, and made confession, and partook of the
holy communion3 and then aster joining in the
eveuing service, he scught from his most familiar friend
benediction, with absolution and the holy kiss, but
being again attecked by paralysis, he lost all the use
of his limbs, and aster lingering in this state for a
time, he at last expired and was buried by the abbots
of Evesham and Tewkesbury.¹
