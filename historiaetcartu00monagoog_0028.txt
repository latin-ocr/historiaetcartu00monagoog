viously been a conon of the church of Avmnches, and
aflerwurds a monh in the church os Mont St.. Michel
in Normundy, sc that he brought with him ample ex-

monks.

During the first years of Serlo's rulo, Se Peter's,
which was then in en imponerishcd condition, found a
ready friend in the neighbouring abbey of Eveshsm3

consecration at Gloucester in 1059, osten relieved its
necessities on the humhle petiticn of Serlo.¹
