brooke, the historian of Glaucester, in his aeacum of
St Petcr’s,¹ falls into a singular mistake, which not
merely perverts the truth, but also gives him un
opportunity of casting an unmerited imputation upon
the abbot and monks of St. Peter's. Though it is not
my province here to play the advocate on the one hand,
or 011 the other hand to correct the mis-statements of
topographical writers, yet in vindication of historical
truth, as well as in desencc of my own version of the
text, Ι will for once step aside from the beaten track.
Our history, in treating of this fire, says, “Et anno
“ millesimo centesimo secundo ecclesia Sancti Petri

. “ Glaucestrise cum civitate, igne cremata cst, postquam

“ venerandae memorie domnus abbas Serlo, per in-
“ dustriam suam ct laborem, terras multas ct pecunias
“ acquisierat, videlicet Ledeue, &a ;''² but Fosbrooke,
in printing this passage, sor poctpcmm substitutas post
praed, thus not only setting at deliancc all correct
ideas of grammar, but making the acquisition of these
lands subsequent to the firc, which he afterwards sug·
gests³ was a merc trick to augment the reveuues of the
church. The text, as I have printed it, will not bear
such an interpretation, and we leam from the calendar
of donatione the dates when St. Peter's acquired these
possessione, -all of which were bestowed upon the
monastery prior to the conflagration, thus proving
that Fosbrooke's accusation is totally groundless.

Tm benefactions which this naouastery owed to
Scrlo were numerous indeed3 Ode also, who alter
sarving his office as cellarcr, took upon him the
religious habit, and became in all things thc friend
