after the death of her husband, was consecrated
abbaso of this place, and after twenty-five years' good
governance of the monastery was buried there near
her predecessor Kyneburgh, in the year 735.

Eva, the wife of Wolfere, son of Pcnda, was next
consecrated abbess; she held the office for thirty-three
years, and was a great benefactress to the monastery;
she died, and was buried there in the year 767.

After this period the abbesses pass from the scene
entirely3 war and tumult occupy the kingdom, and
the nuns wonder hither and thither to avoid the evils
of the timcs; but, though dispersed and their house
broken up, yet, whercsoever they travelled in search
of security from lawlessness and sin, there were they
living witnesses of the virtues which shone forth ao
brightly at St. Peter’s, that neither time nor adverse
circumstances could dim their lustro.

The history is then silent as to the fortunes of this
honae for two centurias and more, but from the
Memoriale in Dugdalc, before referred to, we leam that
for a period of fifty years from the death of Eva
there was no abbees, and the house was deserted and
desolate3 but when Beornulph, King of the Merciana
cameto the throne, he, seeing so deplorable a state of
things, rehuilt the monastery and changed irs form.
Hc placed there secular clergy, for the most part
married, and differing but little in their food and
dress from laymen, and gave them certain prescribed
mles of life, endowing them with the former posses-
sions of the nuns.

In the year 862 our history tells us that Burgred‚
king of Marcie, confirmed all the donatione which his
predecessore had made, and freed st. Peter's and all

its dependcncies from all lay service or exactiori on
condition only that night and day for over there should
not cease to be offered up prayers for him and his

descendants
