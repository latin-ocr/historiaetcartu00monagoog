Exultet coelum laudibus,
Applaudat terra vocibus,

Dum, sicut in coelestibus,
Vita fit in virginibus.

ln coelis ita vivere constat,
Non student nubere,

Sed vultum Dei cernere,
Et ferventer diligere.

Talis est vita virgiuum
Quae contemplantur Dominum,
Totum sibi dant animum,
Vitant amplexus homiuum.

Kynehurga virtutibus
Et insignita moribus
Placuit coeli civibus.
Deo vero sir gloria,
Qui dat de sua gratia
Nobis imitabilia
Virginis exemplmia. Amen.
